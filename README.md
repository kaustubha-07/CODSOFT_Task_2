<h2>CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION</h2>
<li>Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.</li>
<li>Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.</li>
<li>Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.</li>
<li>Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.
